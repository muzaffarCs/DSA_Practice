# ðŸ“˜ DSA Practice

This repository contains my practice solutions for **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.  
All codes are implemented in C++.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
- `String/` â†’ String-related problems & solutions
- `Array/` â†’ Array - implementation (Abstraction)
- `Array_Insertion_Deletion/` â†’ Insertion and Deletion practices in an Array
- `Task_1/` â†’ Array related practice using menu base main file
- `stack_static_array/` â†’ implementation of stack using static array 
- `Stack/` â†’ implementation of stack functions manually in a dynamic way 

## ðŸš€ Goals
- Practice daily DSA problems
- Strengthen problem-solving skills
- Prepare for coding interviews
