# 📘 DSA Practice

This repository contains my practice solutions for **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.  
All codes are implemented in C++.

## 📂 Structure
- `String/` → String-related problems & solutions
- `Array/` → Array - implementation (Abstraction)
- `Array_Insertion_Deletion/` → Insertion and Deletion practices in an Array
- `Task_1/` → Array related practice using menu base main file
- `stack_static_array/` → implementation of stack using static array 
- `Stack/` → implementation of stack functions manually in a dynamic way 
- `infix_to_postfix/` → An application of a stack to convert infix expression into postfix 
- `Evaluate_postfix_Expression/` → An application of a stack to evalutate postfix expression 
- `infix_to_prefix/` → An application of a stack to convert infix expression into prefix 
- `Evaluate_prefix_Expression/` → An application of a stack to evalutate prefix expression 
- `Queue_array_based/` → An implementation of a Queue using an array 
- `Book_Management/` → A complete **Book Management System** that lets a user to add, update, delete, find, display, and export book records while storing all data in a binary file. 
- `forward_list/` →  Implementation of a singly linked list (forward list) with iterator support 
- `circular_singly_linklist/` →  Implementation of a circular singly linked list with **Student Data Management System**  

## 🚀 Goals
- Practice daily DSA problems
- Strengthen problem-solving skills
- Prepare for coding interviews
